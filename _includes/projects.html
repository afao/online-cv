                      <p>Virtual reality (VR) provides their viewers a vicarious experience of reality, 
                        but whether viewing VR with VR headsets will cause visual fatigue is an empirical question worth exploring. 
                        This study was aimed to address two problems: (1) May viewing VR with VR headsets cause visual fatigue? 
                        (2) Do different grades of VR headsets have different effect on visual fatigue? 
                        This study conducted a between-group experiment with both subjective and objective measure to evaluate visual discomfort and visual fatigue 
                        caused by VR headsets. The results show that the subjects viewing VR with VR headsets experienced apparent visual fatigue as compared
                        with those viewing reality with naked eyes and the subjects with the medium-grade VR headset had more significant visual fatigue than 
                        those with the high-end one. The conclusions of this pilot study also give suggestions for the follow-up researches to explore safe 
                        viewing time of VR headsets.</p>
